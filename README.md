# GitHubWebScraperGUI
A bit uncreative, but nevertheless a great way to put two skills together and apply my newly gained knowledge!!!

This repo is essentially a remake of my previous project, but now with GUI :O

Very Fun Stuff, but nothing too serious. Maybe serious cool stuff soon? Who knows.

Thinking of learning JS and going for React in order to make my GUI prettier.
